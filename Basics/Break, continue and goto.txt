Break- Used to exit a loop when a condition is met
- Allows you to immediately exit a loop based on a specific condition,
  even if loops normal exit condition hasn't been met.
- In nested loops, it will exit the inner most loop.

Continue- Used to skip one iteration in the loop, if a specified
	  condition occurs and continues with the next iteration in loop.
	- Code example:
	  for(int i=1; i<=limit; i++)
 	  {
		if(i % 2 == 0)
		{
		   continue; // Skip the odd numbers
		}
		cout << i << endl;
	  }

Goto- It allows you to transfer control to a labeled statement in your program,
      allowing non-linear program flow.

     -  Code Example:
	#include<iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
 	{
	   int n = 10;
	   int target = 5;

	   for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
	   {
		cout << "Iteration " << i << "\n"; 
		
		if(i == target)
		{
		   goto end;
		}
	   }
	   end:
	   cout << "Loop ended at iteration " << target << "\n";
	   return 0;
	}
